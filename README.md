# pass-check-and-gen-py
Password checker and generator based on python.

This project is a secure password generator and password strength checker built using Python.
It provides both password creation and password evaluation through a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

The goal of the project is to help users create strong, unpredictable passwords and understand why a password is weak or strong, following real-world cybersecurity principles.

Files:

pass_gen.py – Secure password creation logic

pass_check.py – Password strength evaluation logic

gui.py – GUI that connects user input to the logic

This design allows the same logic to be reused in CLI, GUI, or web applications.
